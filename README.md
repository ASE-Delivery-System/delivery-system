# ase-delivery-system

ASE Delivery system was developed as part of the Advanced Topics in Software Engineering class. 
Based on the scope of the project description, we have developed a delivery system that coordinates 
the delivery from a central depot via RFID pick-up boxes to customers. 

The system includes functionality for different user roles consisting of dispatchers, deliverers, and customers.
